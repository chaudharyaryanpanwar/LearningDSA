/*
Consider the set of irreducible fractions 
A = {n/d | nâ‰¤d and d and gcd(n,d) = 1}.
You are given a member of this set and your task is to find the largest 
fraction in this set less than the given fraction.
Note: this is a set and so all the members are unique.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1, d = 8
Output: 1249 9993
Explanation: 1/8 >= 1249/9993 and this 
is the largest fraction. 

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, d = 53
Output: 377 9991
Explanation: 2/53 >= 377/9991 and this is 
the largest fraction.

Expected Time Complexity: O(K) where K <= 104
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
